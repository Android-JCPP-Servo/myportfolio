                    <p>Howdy! Thank you so much for viewing my portfolio.</p>
                    <p>My name is Andersen Stewart, and I am a recent graduate of the Brigham Young University - Idaho Computer Science program.</p>
                    <p>All through my schooling careers, I have taken a strong interest in programming. In high school, I was in the Project Lead The Way (PLTW) program, which taught students several engineering principles. The engineering field that really caught my attention was Software Engineering. In college, I focused on programming, especially Web Development and Design.</p>
                    <p>My goal in the next five years is to become a certified Full-Stack Engineer, so I can help people fulfill their goals digitally. I have already begun a course through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog" target="_blank" className="link">Codecademy</a>&copy; that offers certification in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer" className="link" target="_blank">Full-Stack Engineering</a> and other web-dev languages.</p>
                    <p>I also want to become a good husband and father for my future family. I want to raise my children on good, wholesome principles, so they grow up seeking challenges, learning from experience, and helping others do the same.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not building a website, I thoroughly enjoy calisthenics, reading Brandon Sanderson novels or Calvin and Hobbes&copy; comics, and spending time with family. I also enjoy hanging out with friends on weekends and chatting with my girlfriend every night.</p>
                    <p>Thank you again for taking time to view my portfolio! Below, I have listed my educational and work experience as well as projects and certifications I have completed or am in the process of finishing. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out!</p>
