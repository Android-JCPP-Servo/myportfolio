                    <p>Howdy! Thank you so much for viewing my portfolio.</p>
                    <p>My name is Andersen Stewart, and I am a recent graduate of the Brigham Young University - Idaho Computer Science program.</p>
                    <p>All through my schooling career, I have taken a strong interest in programming. In high school, I was involved in the Project Lead The Way (PLTW) program, which provided an overview of Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, and Software Engineering principles. I carried the software principles into my college career, which opened the door to team leadership opportunities and earning additional certifications outside of the cirriculum.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to use my degree, work experience, and current and future certifications to help individuals and businesses reach their digital goals.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I thoroughly enjoy calisthenics, reading, spending time with family and friends, and serving at the Central Texas Food Bank.</p>
                    <p>Thank you again for taking time to view my portfolio! Below, I have listed my educational and work experience as well as projects and certifications I have completed or am in the process of finishing. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out!</p>
