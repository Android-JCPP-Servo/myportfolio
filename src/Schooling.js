                    {/* <p>On April 6, 2023, I graduated from Brigham Young University - Idaho with a degree in Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>My original focus for BYU-I was to learn programming for robotics. I enjoy building and working with robots. However, my schooling career led me down a different path.</p>
                    <p>As time progressed, my interests flowed into Web Development and Design. I thoroughly enjoy watching  websites come to life as I build them. Ever since my first Web Development course, I have been "bit by the bug" and cannot stop building sites.</p>
                    <p>My internship and Senior Project were both heavily involved in Web Development and Design. During my internship, I helped build the product website for <a href="https://www.streamit.live/" target="_blank" className="link">Stream It, Inc.</a> using Vue.js. Now, during my Senior Project, I am rebuilding the website using Drupal.</p>
                    <p>While these projects and courses were not originally what I intended, my interest in them has been more than piqued, and I cannot wait to continue building websites and other desktop and mobile applications.</p> */}

                    <h3>Codecademy<sup>TM</sup> Professional Certifications</h3>
                    <p>For the past two years, I have been pursuing additional certifications to augment my schooling experience, including learning additional programming languages and platforms and gaining Full-Stack Development expertise.</p>
                    <p>Through Codecademy, I have gained the following certifications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML5</li>
                        <li>CSS3</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Currently, I am pursuing a professional certification through Codecademy to become a certified Full-Stack Engineer. According to Codecademy, the certification process is designed to help students "build web applications from start to finish. This path will start with the front-end, move to the back-end, then connect the two."</p>

                    <h3>Millennial Choirs & Orchestra</h3>
                    <p>My vocal experience started in a community children's choir in which I participated for years. In my late teen and adults years, my experience includes singing in church choirs comprised of all-male and mixed female-and-male choirs with all four parts. I have also performed solos with accompaniment for Church Christmas events. In addition, I have experience with making a personal professional-grade recording in a recording studio. The recording consisted of me singing solo pieces with accompaniment.</p>
                    <p>I have recently joined the Millennial Choirs and Orchestra (MCO), singing in the Baritone section. Our focus is to sing hymns and other songs that point to the Reason for the Season. MCO also performs nationwide, going on tour once a year to locations such as Carnegie Hall to perform pre-selected hymns and other songs.</p>
