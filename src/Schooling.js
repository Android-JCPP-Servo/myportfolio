                    <h3>Millennial Choirs & Orchestra</h3>
                    <p>My vocal experience started in a community children's choir in which I participated for years. In my late teen and adults years, my experience includes singing in church choirs comprised of all-male and mixed female-and-male choirs with all four parts. I have also performed solos with accompaniment for Church Christmas events. In addition, I have experience with making a personal professional-grade recording in a recording studio. The recording consisted of me singing solo pieces with accompaniment.</p>
                    <p>I have recently joined the Millennial Choirs and Orchestra (MCO), singing in the Baritone section. Our focus is to sing hymns and other songs that point to the Reason for the Season. MCO also performs nationwide, going on tour once a year to locations such as Carnegie Hall to perform pre-selected hymns and other songs.</p>
